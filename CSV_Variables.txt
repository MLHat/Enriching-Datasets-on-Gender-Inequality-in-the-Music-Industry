This file serves to explain several of the variables that are collected through scraping the Top100
	Name: contains the name of the festival
	Country: the country in which the festival took place. In this case it is the Top100 Benelux thus the result will be either Netherlands, Belgium,
		   or Luxemburg.
	Genres: the main genres of the festival
	Lineups: there are for tables containing lineups. These are 2017, 2018, 2019, and Other.
		   the main focus of the study was 2017, 2018, and 2019 because this was the focus of the recent Female:pressure survey.
		   The other_lineups however were collected because they could still contain relevant information for a different study.
