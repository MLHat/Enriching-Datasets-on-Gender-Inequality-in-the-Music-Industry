# Enriching-Datasets-on-Gender-Inequality-in-the-Music-Industry

The main objective of this project is to examine how data collection on gender inequality in the music industry can be enriched and supplemented using automated collection from digital sources. We strive to supplement the data already collected by female:pressure, an organization which focuses on gender inequality in the music industry. In order to achieve this, we created a Jupyter Notebook that uses tools designed for web scraping with the intention of enriching and supplementing data that is already available. In order to achieve our objective mentioned above, the following steps were taken:

Assessment of possible sources

Ethical considerations

Establishing the requirements of the tool

Developing and testing the code

Quality check

The data will be organised in the commonly used and non-proprietary csv-format. Explanation of the steps mentioned above is available in the report. Our conclusion is that there is a benefit to automated scraping, it does speed up the process of data collection. However, there are a few limitations. Prior knowledge of scraping is beneficial, as well as the fact that the time it took to create the Notebook might compare to the time it would take to gather data manually. The Notebook created has a limited reusability, it uses tags that are used specifically by Electronic-Festivals.com. The tool created could serve as a basis for other websites or as inspiration for other projects.
